# Kaia Chain Foundry Kit

## Overview

The Kaia Chain Foundry Kit is a collection of code samples and tools designed to help developers build, deploy, and integrate smart contract services on the Kaia Chain. This kit is particularly useful for those looking to develop decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based solutions with full support for the Kaia Chain ecosystem.

## Purpose

The purpose of this kit is to simplify the development process by providing:

- Sample smart contracts and configurations for common use cases on the Kaia Chain.
- Preconfigured environments to quickly start building with Foundry.
- Tools and utilities that help in testing, deployment, and interacting with the Kaia Chain.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Foundry Environment**: Comes with an easy-to-use setup for smart contract development.
- **Code Samples**: Includes contract templates for various use cases, such as token transfers, swaps, DeFi protocols, and NFT minting.
- **Kaia Chain Integration**: Built-in support for Kaia Chain-specific configurations and libraries.
- **Unit Testing**: Sample unit tests are included for all major functionalities.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Simplifies the deployment process on Kaia Chain using Foundry and custom scripts.

## Requirements

- **Foundry**: This kit uses [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) for smart contract development. Make sure you have it installed.
- **Node.js**: For running deployment and interaction scripts.
- **Kaia Chain**: A Kaia Chain-compatible wallet and connection to the network are required for deployment.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
